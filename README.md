## RULES

#### Play actions
dealer rolls `1d10`, or the "Giant," setting a target number, or the "Knee"

if dealer rolls a 1, the Giant "Kicks" and the house wins

player rolls 2d6, or the "Halflings," trying to match or exceed the Knee

on a double 1 roll, a snake scares the Giant and bets push

if the player rolls an 11/12, or the "Maw," the Halflings are eaten and the house wins

players who hit the Knee exactly may split the dice by doubling their bet. when splitting, players roll one additional die per split, and all the normal rules apply.

the player may split a second time if they wish to become legendary


#### Payouts
if the Knee is 2-3, house pays 1:1

Knee is 4-6, house pays 2:1

Knee is 7-9, house pays 3:1

Knee is 10, house pays 5:1

#### Some Clarifications
edit for some further information from re-watching some play segments and interpreting some wording:

you don't need doubles to split, just matching the Knee. so if the Knee is a 6 and you roll a 4 and a 2 on the Halflings, you can split.

you are never required to split, all of the rules say you "may" split. so in the 4 and 2 example above, you can take your winnings at 2:1, or split.

when splitting, you double your bet in the pot and roll a new Halfling to accompany the split of the initial Halfling rolls. so in that 4 and 2 example above, you'd roll 2 new dice, one to go with the 4 and one to go with the 2.

if a bet pushes, everyone gets their ante back from the pot and the game effectively "resets." no one loses, no one gains. Roll a new round with a new Knee and new Halfling rolls.

becoming legendary means you've effectively quadrupled your bet. doesn't seem to actually have a lot to do with game mechanics, but good for the DM to introduce some social stuff around the game.
