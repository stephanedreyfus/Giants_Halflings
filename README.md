### A Game of Chance in Which Halflings Attempt to Take On a Giant
Giants and Halflings is a game of chance created by [Jerry Holkins][1], and implemented in [a game][2] of [D&D][3] that he was ([and still is][4]) running for his friends.

## RULES
*Halflings and Giants* is a game of chance where you, the Halflings, gamble against the house, the Giant.

By rolling `two six sided die` the Halflings need to beat the Giant's roll of `a single ten sided die`.

The game begins with the Halflings placing a wager into the pot. The Giant then rolls setting the `Knee`.

The Halflings, the player, then click to roll each die individually. You are trying to roll *higher than the Knee*. If you succeed, you get varying levels of payout depending on the height of the Knee.

### Intriguing events:

- If the Giant rolls a `one`, this is the `Kick`. The Giant wins automatically.
- If the Halflings roll `two ones`, that is the `Snake`. The Giant flees in fear and the game resets to placing a wager.
- If the Halflings roll an `11 or 12` they leap into the `Maw`. This is another automatic win for the Giant.
- If the Halflings hit the Knee exactly, they may chose to `split` their dice. The Halfling will then roll a total of `four` dice, `each pair` representing `half` of the
`doubled` wager. Each pair rolled will follow the normal rules.
- If the Halflings hit the Knee *again* while split they can choose to go `Legendary`. They now roll `eight` dice, with `each pair` representing a `quarter` of their `quadrupled` wager.

### Payouts!
- If the Knee is 2-3, house pays 1:1
- If the Knee is 4-6, house pays 2:1
- If the Knee is 7-9, house pays 3:1
- If the Knee is 10, house pays 5:1
